This repository contains the workflow for applying an integrated hydrologic model to simulate groundwater discharge and estimate baseflow in a snow-dominated watershed. It also explores various conceptual baseflow separation methods, provides tools for visualizing the results, and includes post-processing data analysis. The repository is structured as follows:

```bash
├── data
├── notebooks
└── figures
```

- `data`: Contains the raw and processed data used for hydrologic modeling and baseflow separation.
- `notebooks`: Includes Jupyter Notebooks used for generating maps, running the model, and creating statistics and figures for the baseflow separation methods.
- `figures`: Stores the visual outputs (graphs, charts) resulting from the modeling and analysis.
